#burnIgram
=========

burnIgram based on [instagrim](https://github.com/acobley/instagrim)- used in the AC52009 Internet Programming class at University of Dundee.
It's a project to learn more about Java servlets, JSP and using [cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org/).

The original project was extended not only by adding obvious functions like rotating pictures, changing their brightness, but also by adding client based dynamic salt supported encryption when signing in.
